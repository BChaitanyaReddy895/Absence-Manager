# Absence-Manager
project is all about if any student attends any technical events such as hackathons, meet ups and if any student is absent for the classes for a genuine reason they can login into the website and they can fill the appropriate event and leave forms in prior and submit those forms such that those forms are finally approved by attendance coordinators
