# Absence-Manager
This project is all about if any student attends any technical events such as hackathons, meet ups and if any student is absent for the classes for a genuine reason they can login into the website and they can fill the appropriate event and leave forms in prior and submit those forms such that those forms are finally approved by attendance coordinators after on approval from the respective mentors and event coordinators for the respective events. Finally after on approval from the attendance coordinators the attendance will be given to students. 
The unique feature of this website is it always send the real time updates of approval or disapproval of the forms submitted by the students from the attendance coordinators, mentors and eventÂ coordinators.
